## completenes
- Introdce deform versioning
- handle updates to already defined configurations and resource types previously marked as missing
- Decide on the split: all vs used parameters
  * The configs (`aws/*.yaml` files) have to be groupped into categories:
    . `full` - based on the semi-automated matching between tf and crossplane rpvider specs
    . `used` - based only the values used in input tfstate
    . `minimal` - minimal set that would allow crossplane to claim existing resource and fetch its current parameters
- Introduce a global `deform` configuration file with parameters:
  * crossplane provider: name, version
  * terraform provider: name, version (?)
  * compatible terraform versions
  * compatible crossplane versions
  * compatible deform (api) versions
- add script/instructions for installing and configuring additional crossplane providers - such as `provider-kubernetes` to generate Secrets (see: `extraRawResources` in `aws/AwsDbInstance.yaml`)
- detect and base64-encode fields called `password` within each "raw XR"
  (NOTE: it's not very "raw" anymore)
- detect when target crossplane resource has a required `region` field
  and automatically add the conversion definition (via metadata.annotations['extracted.import.deform.io/awsRegion'])

## extra functionality
- propagate the status of child resource to the parent
  * at the stage of XRD extraction, identify "spec" paths that are actually status and mark (reaname) them as such
- Experiment with identifying possible input variables within a single imported tf module (state)
  * extract all defined string variables, along with their paths
  * sort by value
  * suggest creating variables above threshold of 1 occurence
- (?) With the above list established, generate an XRD+Composition set for the entire module
  * How to treat the single values?
    > Some could be generated based on the module name and some of the identified variables
    > Definitely some (under manual inspection) will be screaming to be renamed...
    > However, that would be completely out of scope. The main value in current project design lies in zero downtime migration.
- add crossplane install scripts/configs
  * kind config file for cluster creation
  * scripted(?) helm installation of crossplane+provider
  * alternatively: use the new installation means used by crossplane itself (see gh issue from a few months ago)
- add a general warning about potentially sensitive data contained in:
  * terraform state output files,
  * the `in/` directory,
  * k8s objects in the `raw.import.deform.io` api group (generated by deform)
- consider possible functionality around:
  * `depends_on` module list
  * `data` resources
- Detect/configure resource types that provide functionalities already covered elsewhere - such as IAM Policies vs AwsIamRolePolicy etc.
